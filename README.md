# ModularArticulation
Master Thesis's Repository

The industry tends to increasingly automate as many processes as possible, and to make this possible, they often resort to the use of robotic arms. So, this work has as main goal to develop a proposal for a modular joint for robotic arms that allows: to obtain the best possible torque/weight ratio; to be controlled in speed and/or position; to communicate with other joints and external microcontrollers; to keep the cost as low as possible; and to be easily reconfigurable.
